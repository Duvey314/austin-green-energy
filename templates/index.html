                    <h1>Model Details</h1>
                    <p>This model is a culmination of a 5-week capstone project for the UT Austin Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp. For the project, the team harnessed the data analytical tools taught throughout the 24-week Bootcamp such as Python, JavaScript, and database integration. Using our proficiencies in core Python, we retrieved weather data from online resources, organized it into easily-accessible data formats and interpreted the data relationships. Along with historical energy output, the weather data has been utilized in a machine learning model to make energy output predictions. This dashboard tells our data story with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and has been deployed over Heroku.</p>
                    <p>Our team collaborated with Austin Energy, a publicly owned utility that provides electrical power to the city of Austin and other surrounding areas in Texas. This project uses 2017-2020 hourly megawatt data from Austin Energy’s farms: Hackberry Wind Farm and Webberville Solar Farm as well as hourly historical weather data to train a machine learning model.  Using this model, we created  The Austin Energy Predictor, which can be used to determine energy output in Megawatt-Hours (MWH) per renewable energy farm, specifically wind and solar farms.</p>
                    <p>The output of the machine learning model had to be a continuous value, so we knew we would need some form of regression model. We first used a linear regression model for both datasets and had mixed results. The solar regression model had an accuracy of about 60%, but didn’t do a good job of handling night times when there was no output at all. The wind regression model could only get the barest shape of the output and had an accuracy score of 30%.</p>
                    <p>The next iteration of our model was a neural network using Tensorflow’s machine learning library. This model was trained on the data from 2017-2019, and then tested on the data from 2020. The solar model does a great job of predicting output and is nearly perfect and modeling when the panels start and stop producing in the morning and evening. This model had a mean absolute error of 1.5 MWH. The wind model still had difficulty getting an accurate prediction but could match the shape of the output much better than the regression model and had a mean absolute error of about 25 MWH.</p>
                    <p>The combination of MWH output and weather data allows the model to predict energy output based on weather factors - such as temperature, wind speed and direction, and cloud coverage. As the model was trained on three years’ data, the model comprises weather variations that are observed across different seasons. We were able to take January-July 2020 output and weather data for the above farms to test the model and evaluate its accuracy.</p>
                    <p>The data insights generated by the model are vital since renewable energy generation varies continuously throughout the day and based on available wind and sunshine. We hope to utilize the model on all of Austin Energy’s renewable energy farms and expand the model to include peak power generation times. With this model, Austin Energy will have a more refined understanding of its overall energy output and when renewable energy generated will be at its highest.</p>

                            <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px">Collin enjoy’s the continuous pursuit of acquiring new knowledge and discovering the ‘how’ or ‘why’. Whether a personal interest or career opportunity, he values the challenge of making the unfamiliar, familiar. Collin has spent the past 5 years working in hotels where Customer Service was not just a department, but a model for creating customer experiences. Working with clients from around the globe, in diverse industries, and with varying definitions of success has given me the opportunity to develop that model into his own philosophy on service and personal interactions. His latest endeavor to gain technical skills in Data and Analysis has provided a fresh path for continued discovery.</p>
