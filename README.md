## Overview
The problem statement is, "To determine the cleanest time to use energy as a consumer in Austin based on peak power generation", The idea is to combine weather data, power generation peak outputs, renewable energy contribution to the peak power generation and tell consumers when the energy on the grid will be the "cleanest."

## Datasets
